The following files were converted from an import that was stored lossy.
You may lose fidelity when re-importing these files upon loading the project.
res://.godot/imported/apple.jpg-8b4d03f0193a859c86e2f0f03e368896.ctex to res://textures/ui/apple.jpg
------

The following files were converted and saved to a non-original path, but did not have their import data rewritten.
These files will not be re-imported when loading the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 4.4.0.stable to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
